        <img src="/images/DSC01642(1)(1).jpg" />Hello!! People. This is Ananta Durga Prasad.
        So, you want to know more about me ha!..Let's See.
        I'm from a small town , madanapalli , A.P. <br>
        <strong>My First Program</strong> <br>
        <!-- words are recognised by space. 
        see what happens when you remove space between town and , and madanapalli -->
        I realized I was interested in coding during my 
        7 or 8th class when I wrote my first code that converts temperature
        between different systems.
        But I couldn't pursue it at that time😕. <br>
        <strong>Present</strong><br>
        Fast Forward to college.I'm pursuing b.tech in Co
        mputer science and constantly amazed at the beauty of this whole new software world.
       <br> <strong>Why cybersecurity?</strong><br>
        I'm a guy who doesn't like to take anything by faith. I love to know every granular detail 
        that makes  something work.
        Tweaking these values and make the system do things its not supposed do is something cool.
        And guys that how i got into cybersecurity.
